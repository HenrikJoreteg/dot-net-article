# Summary

Over the next two months Henrik will walk us through building a realtime team dashboard app, end-to-end. It will leverage node.js and backbone.js to build a "glowingly realtime" single-page web application. In doing so, he'll cover tools and techniques to make the code as clean, readable and maintainable as possible.
